                <br><br>
              <p>Next, I worked on developing a static webpage for my profile. This task helped me apply my HTML and CSS skills to create a personalized webpage that showcased my skills and interests. I learned about CSS properties such as flexbox and grid that helped me create a responsive layout for my profile page.</p>
              <p>I embarked on the next phase of my journey by crafting a static webpage dedicated to my profile. This task not only allowed me to further hone my HTML and CSS skills but also provided an opportunity to create a personalized space that reflected my skills and interests. As I delved deeper into this project, I explored various CSS properties such as flexbox and grid, which proved instrumental in crafting a responsive and visually appealing layout for my profile page.</p>
              <p>One of the key aspects I incorporated into my profile page was the use of hover effects. By leveraging CSS hover selectors, I added interactive elements that responded dynamically to user actions. This not only enhanced the user experience but also added a touch of interactivity to my page, making it more engaging.</p>
              <p>Additionally, I delved into CSS transitions, which allowed me to animate changes in properties such as color, size, and position. These subtle animations added a layer of polish to my profile page, making it feel more dynamic and modern.</p>
              <p>Typography played a crucial role in shaping the visual identity of my profile page. I experimented with different fonts, sizes, and styles to create a harmonious and readable layout. By choosing the right fonts and applying them thoughtfully, I was able to convey a sense of professionalism and personality through my profile page.</p>
              <p>Overall, this project was not just about creating a static webpage; it was a creative exploration that deepened my understanding of HTML and CSS.

                <br><br>
              <p>I then moved on to creating a static webpage with six buttons, each featuring a different animation. This task introduced me to the world of CSS animations and transitions, allowing me to add interactive elements to my webpage. I experimented with various animation properties such as transform and transition to create visually appealing effects.</p>
              <p>I progressed to the next stage by creating a dynamic static webpage featuring six buttons, each showcasing a unique animation. This task was my gateway into the realm of CSS animations and transitions, offering me a hands-on experience in incorporating interactive elements into my webpage. Through this project, I delved into various animation properties, such as transform and transition, to craft visually captivating effects that enhanced the overall user experience.</p>
              <p>Each button on the webpage was meticulously designed to exhibit a distinct animation upon interaction. By utilizing CSS :hover pseudo-class, I ensured that each button responded dynamically to user actions, adding a layer of interactivity that made the webpage more engaging and immersive.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, I explored different transition effects for each button, employing CSS transition property to animate changes in properties such as color, size, and position. These transitions not only added a touch of elegance to the webpage but also provided visual cues that guided users through the interactive elements.</p>
              <p>In terms of creativity, I pushed the boundaries of conventional design by incorporating unique visual elements and layouts. From vibrant color schemes to innovative button placements, I aimed to create a webpage that not only showcased my technical skills but also captivated the audience with its creativity and ingenuity.</p>
