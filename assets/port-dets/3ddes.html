              <h1>Exploring the World of 3D Design with Fusion 360</h1>
              <h2>Getting Started:</h2>
              <p>My journey into the fascinating world of 3D design began with an introduction to Autodesk's Fusion 360 software. This powerful tool, renowned for its versatility and user-friendly interface, opened up a realm of possibilities for creating intricate 3D models. After creating an account on Fusion 360, I accessed the software using my college's ID card, granting me access to an educational license.</p>
              <p>As I delved deeper into Fusion 360, I was captivated by its capabilities, from creating simple geometric shapes to designing complex mechanical parts. The software's intuitive design and extensive feature set allowed me to unleash my creativity and bring my ideas to life in the digital realm.</p>
              <p>One of the most exciting aspects of learning Fusion 360 was the ability to visualize and iterate on my designs in real-time. The software's parametric modeling capabilities enabled me to make precise adjustments to my models, ensuring they met the desired specifications.</p>
              <p>The model I created at the first day of learning, using fusion 360:</p>
