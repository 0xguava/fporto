              <h1>Module 04: 3D Printing</h1>
              <h2>Introduction to 3D Printing:</h2>
              <p>3D printing is a revolutionary technology that allows for the creation of three-dimensional objects from digital models. This process, also known as additive manufacturing, builds objects layer by layer, unlike traditional subtractive manufacturing methods that remove material to create an object. 3D printing has a wide range of applications across various industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, aerospace, and education. It enables rapid prototyping, customization, and complex geometries that would be difficult or impossible to achieve with traditional manufacturing methods.</p>
              <h2>Exporting and Preparing Models for Printing:</h2>
              <p>To prepare a 3D model for printing, it needs to be exported to a format that is compatible with 3D printing software, such as .stl (stereolithography) file format. Once the model is in .stl format, it can be imported into slicing software like UltimakerCura. Slicing software prepares the model for printing by generating a toolpath for the 3D printer to follow, slicing the model into layers and calculating the necessary parameters for printing.</p>

              <h2>Printing Process and Understanding UltimakerCura:</h2>
              <p>UltimakerCura is a popular slicing software used in the 3D printing community. It offers a range of functions to optimize the printing process, such as adjusting print settings like layer height, print speed, and infill density. It also provides features for previewing the print, estimating print time and material usage, and adding supports where necessary. Understanding how to use UltimakerCura is essential for achieving successful 3D prints and maximizing the capabilities of your 3D printer.</p>

              <h2>Types of Supports in 3D Printing:</h2>
              <p>Supports are structures that are printed alongside the main object to support overhanging or complex features during printing. There are several types of supports available in 3D printing, including grid, line, and tree supports. Tree supports, in particular, are gaining popularity due to their sustainability and efficiency. They use less material and are easier to remove compared to traditional supports, reducing waste and post-processing time. Choosing the right type of support is crucial for achieving high-quality prints with minimal cleanup.</p>

              <h2>In FABLAB we have Fracktal Works 3D Printer's extended version</h2>
              <img src="../img/assigments/3dprint/Parts-of-julia.png" style=" height: 650px; width: auto;" alt="">
              <p>The Fractal Works 3D printer is an extended version of the standard Fractal Works printer, designed for use in Fab Labs and other advanced fabrication environments. This extended version offers additional features and capabilities compared to the standard model, making it suitable for more complex and larger-scale projects. The printer is known for its reliability and precision, making it a popular choice among makers and professionals alike.</p>
              <p>One of the key features of the Fractal Works 3D printer's extended version is its larger build volume, allowing users to create larger objects or multiple smaller objects in a single print job. This expanded capacity opens up new possibilities for fabrication and prototyping, enabling users to tackle more ambitious projects. Additionally, the extended version may include upgraded components or enhanced software capabilities, further improving the overall performance and usability of the printer.</p>
              <h2>Hands-On with the Fractal Works Extended Printer</h2>
              <p>After the introductory session, our mentor led my group to the 3D printer, where we were able to see the machine up close and learn about its components. The 3D printer was a fascinating piece of technology, with various parts working together to create three-dimensional objects layer by layer. The mentor explained the basic concept of 3D printing, emphasizing how it differs from traditional manufacturing methods and highlighting its advantages in terms of speed, customization, and complexity of shapes that can be produced.</p>

              <img src="../img/assigments/3dprint/p3.png" alt="">
              <p>The mentor then delved into the workings of the 3D printer, explaining its different functions and how each contributes to the printing process. We learned about the printer's extruder, which melts and deposits the printing material (usually plastic filament) layer by layer to build the object. The printer's bed, on which the object is built, was also highlighted, as it needs to be leveled correctly for successful prints. The mentor discussed the importance of choosing the right print settings, such as layer height and print speed, to achieve the desired quality and strength of the printed object. Additionally, we learned about the importance of proper maintenance and calibration of the printer to ensure consistent and reliable performance.</p>

              <img src="../img/assigments/3dprint/p6.png" alt="">
              <p>One interesting feature of the 3D printer was its small display, which served as a control panel for operating the machine. The display allowed users to navigate through the printer's settings and options, such as selecting a file to print, adjusting print settings, and monitoring the progress of a print job. The mentor demonstrated how to use the display to start a print, pause or cancel a print job, and troubleshoot common issues that may arise during printing. The display also showed useful information, such as the temperature of the extruder and bed, the progress of the print, and any error messages that may need attention.</p>

              <img src="../img/assigments/3dprint/p13.png" alt="">
              <p>Another useful feature of the 3D printer that the mentor highlighted was its ability to record timelapse videos of the printing process. This feature allows users to capture the entire printing process from start to finish, providing a visual record of how the object was created layer by layer. Timelapse videos can be useful for monitoring the print remotely, troubleshooting printing issues, or simply for sharing the process with others. The mentor explained how to set up and start a timelapse recording, as well as how to access and save the recorded video for future reference or sharing.</p>
